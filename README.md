CASAA Legislatr
===============

A rather simple node.js side project to aggregate data from SunlightLabs.org's OpenStates project.

At the moment, this project is in a beta development stage and is sure to have several bugs.

How does it work?
-----------------

It pulls the data off the API at openstates.sunlightlabs.org and displays the data formatted to the user.



More information coming soon.
